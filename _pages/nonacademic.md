## Rubik's Cube

![](../images/rubiks.gif)

My journey with the Rubik's cube started way back in class 5 when I was fascinated with the puzzle. Slowly I started getting better at solving it, when in class 10, I was able to solve in just around 13 seconds! I slowly adapted myself to solving a variety of different twisty puzzles, and can today solve more than 15 kinds of twisties!

## Torque

Torque is the annual campus magazine of IITGN. I joined the Torque 3.0 team as the Chief Editor of the Editorial Board. It took a lot of effort to write, collaborate, and go from releasing the online version of the magazine to actually printing it amidst a pandemic!

## Team LaTeX

![](../images/latex_2.jpg)

Team LaTeX was born with the spirit of inculcating a technical culture in the institute.  LaTeX is a popular typesetting tool used in most academic works, and we hosted a two day workshop to improve the understanding of LaTeX amongst the students of IITGN. In my first year, I was a organizer, and in my second year, managed the entire event.





## Writing

I occasionally like to write on my experiences and things that I did uniquely. Checkout some of my articles below.

- GRE: My Test Centre Experience | by Praveen Venkatesh | Medium 

- Cracking the MITACS Globalink Research Internship (GRI) | by Praveen Venkatesh | Medium  - Record number of people cracked MITACS from IITGN after the article. Correlation --> Causation? I hope so :)

- Invent@IITGN 2019 Experience - Praveen | Academic Council | IIT Gandhinagar 

- Pandemic? What pandemic? We’re Innovators! - Torque 

An old blog website that I had. A peek into 2nd year Praveen XD - Random Thoughts – A peek into my mind (wordpress.com) 

More on my experiences on applying to grad school, and how I dominated GRE and TOEFL. Stay tuned...
