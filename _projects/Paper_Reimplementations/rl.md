Created a custom environment for reinforcement learning for multiple cars to learn to drive using the PPO and A2C algorithms.

Implemented the genetic algorithm with random mutations from scratch to create a biological speciation based reinforcement learning algorithm.

It was quite a fun mini project to work on !
