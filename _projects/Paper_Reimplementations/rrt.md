Python implementation of the RRT* (Rapidly Exploring Random Tree) algorithm. This probabilistic algorithm is used extensively in path planning for high dimensional robotics applications as a fast method to determine an approximately optimal path between any two points given a set of constraints.  Works in N dimensional space!

The github linked above is only for RRT, but the animation is for RRT*. Something cool is in the works, so it's still private :)
