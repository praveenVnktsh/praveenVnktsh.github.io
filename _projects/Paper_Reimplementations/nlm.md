Denoising is a very important part of several computer vision algorithms. Here, I implemented the Non Local means Filter described in the paper "A. Buades, B. Coll and J. -. Morel, "A non-local algorithm for image denoising," 2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05), San Diego, CA, USA, 2005, pp. 60-65 vol. 2, doi: 10.1109/CVPR.2005.38" using python.
