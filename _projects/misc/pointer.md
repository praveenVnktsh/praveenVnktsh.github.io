**Deemed best course project - Electronic Devices '19 @ IITGN**

A normal presentation pointer often has issues with safety where shining light on people can cause health issues. Moreover, pointers are usually small when used in large auditoria. We solve this problem by designing a new device that solves these problems by utilizing the mouse as a pointer using an external device.
