Created an indoor emulation of an autonomous survey and rescue system using the Pluto quadcopter and ROS. Simulated the entire system on Gazebo before the final implementation on real hardware. Utilized the WhyCon system to localize the drone in 3D space, and issue appropriate commands. Utilized computer vision to detect survey/rescue zones and plan efficient paths given a set of constraints.
