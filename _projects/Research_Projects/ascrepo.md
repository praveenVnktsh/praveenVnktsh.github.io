In this project, I 3D scanned several bone artifacts (over 100!), and created a digital repository of the same for archeozoological research. Done in collaboration with Prof C V Sharada at IITGN.

### Fun facts

- I accidentally broke the mandible of a rhesus macaque when scanning. To prove that my scans were complete, I 3D printed the bone at full scale and reattached it with the original cranium.
- There were several roadblocks in the project where the scanner sometimes failed to scan small objects and it took over 1 hour just to scan a single piece!
- The scanner I was using broke down in the middle of the project. I had to rent a new scanner with better specs by obtaining funding for the project from the Archaeology department at IIT Gandhinagar!
