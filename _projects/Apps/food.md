Ever tired of waiting in a queue just for getting a soft drink? We developed an order processing system that makes life significantly easier and reduces queue wait times. A dual app based solution streamlines and makes life easy for both students and stores, and improves store revenue.

This app was first designed and developed as part of a hackathon.

This project was funded by IITGN via the EWYL program.

### Features
- Streamlined realtime application for both the customer and the shopkeeper.
- Fully fledged system based on Firebase that allows for users to order and pay from within the app directly, and allowing shopkeepers to maintain and accept incoming orders similar to apps such as Zomato and Swiggy.


Unfortunately the app was not launched due to administrative issues.
