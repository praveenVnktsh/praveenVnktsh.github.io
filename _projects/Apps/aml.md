Created the official mobile app using Flutter for Amalthea '19 - the technical summit of IIT-GN, for the first time in the history of the event. Noticing the requirement for mass campaigning, I put together a small two member team and implemented the project from ground up. This was my first ever fully fledged mobile development project that has been deployed to production.


This was a full-stack app that was built on an architected software stack containing the following features:
- Uber-smooth UI and responsive mobile focused design of the app
- Custom designed google sheets API developed from the ground up which allowed for participants to engage in live timed quizzes.
- Firebase backend that streamlined all registrations and event traffic.
- Notification systems for continued engagement.



### Results

- This was the only time in the history of the event that an app was released and all registration and event traffic was channelled through indigenously developed software.
- Phenomenal reach with over 1500 downloads. 
- Combined with the Amalthea website, the entire system gave unprecedented reach with a true footfall on the day of the event of over 9000 people.
