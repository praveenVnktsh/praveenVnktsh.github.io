A first in the history of IITGN, I spearheaded a team of six to develop a new mobile application that can make life easy for students. With over 15 new features in the timeline, InsIIT aims to be the next big thing in open source space at IITGN.

This project was funded through the EWYL program at IITGN.

### Results

- Over 1200 users (of a community comprising 1700 people) and widely loved by faculty, students, staff and everyone!!
- Popular appeal with community :)
- We hosted a flutter workshop as part of this project to expand the entire the project to a better application that integrates with laundry services, COVID monitoring etc.
