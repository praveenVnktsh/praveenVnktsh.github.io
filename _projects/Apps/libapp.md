The Library at IITGN was website-only for quite a long time. When a couple of my batchmates (Ayush and Hari) asked me whether I'd take up a project to develop an app for the library, I instantly said yes!

I independently built an application that makes the library significantly easier to use. Apart from improving the library experience, the app also helps students ease their academic life by being able to check for the availability of textbooks directly from their phones.


Development was funded by the EWYL program at IIT Gandhinagar.

### Results

- Over 500 users on the app.
- App was refreshed in 2022 and migrated to a newer technology stack.
