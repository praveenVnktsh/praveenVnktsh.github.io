We invented this device to aid people who have lost control of their arm through disorders and amputations. The device, upon receiving a trigger, scoops food from a plate, and brings it to the users mouth where the person can eat food easily. The device is easy to use and can be optionally controlled by giving a voice command. What's better is that this device is extremely portable, and can be used in a restaurant if one wishes to do so. We filed a provisional patent application both in India as well as the USA for the invention.
