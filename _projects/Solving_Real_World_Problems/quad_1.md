Drone's are becoming widespread these days. Here, we present one such application, where a drone serves as a rapid surveillance and data collection system by deploying several sensors. These sensors collect data, that, depending on the type of situation, can be used to come up with early strategies that can help contain the situation. In this project, we implemented the entire system from scratch, without using any off the shelf controllers. This means that each component, be it the drone's flight computer, the computer vision algorithms, and even the serialization protocol were implemented from ground up!
