Ever injured yourself to the point where you were asked to use crutches? If yes, you would have seen that it is extremely painful and cumbersome to use. Apart from causing a lot of pain in the wrist and underarms, it leaves the user tired and unable to perform regular tasks. To combat this issue, we came up with a unique design for the crutches that vastly eases the life of a person with lower leg injuries.

Presented at the Intra IITGN Design Competition 

We ended up actually manufacturing the product after the design phase.
