Joined the team for fun exploring a new field. We made a centrifugal pump using 3D printer and laser cut parts.

Presented at Ignite, IITGN, 2018

### Interesting things

- We realized that the pump was not watertight and constantly dripped water. We plugged it by adding a layer of epoxy.
- The final pump kinda worked, but not amazingly well...
- The end result was a system that was able to pump water without direct contact with the fluid.
