Designed a modified version of a cycle by combining two cycles to make a quadricycle. This project was split into two parts - a design project to design and build a CAD model of a device that can solve a problem, and another to actually build the machine in real life. We developed a quadricycle designed to ease the problem of quickly drawing water from wells and transporting it over large distances. We also built a simplified version of the machine in real life and tested it over a multi-terrain 2km track.
