I got really bored trying to make animations from scratch every time. Hence, decided to make this awesome wrapper on top of OpenCV that makes visualizing scientific simulations a breeze!

Whatever you can imagine - chaotic double pendulum, Non Linear ODE's, robotic arms, all visualized brilliantly, and in real-time. A significant leap up from the slow plotting of matplotlib. 

Conducted a python workshop utilizing this for a graduate level Introduction to Robotics Course. Check out my workshop here:
